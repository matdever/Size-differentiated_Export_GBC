% Mat: I think that even with the submesoscale mechanism, export is mainly driven by gravitational sinking. So I'm moving the "Traditionally" to later. 
Export of particulate organic carbon (POC) is  mainly driven by gravitational sinking. Thus, traditionally, it is thought that larger, faster-sinking particles make up most of the POC export flux. However, this need not be the case in a dynamic oceanic flow field, where the ocean velocity can influence the descent rate of particles. Particles with different settling speeds are released in two process-oriented model simulations of an upper ocean eddying flow to evaluate the impact of (1) the ocean dynamics on the respective contribution of the different sinking-velocity classes to POC export, and (2) the particle number size-spectrum slope. The analysis reveals that the leading export mechanism changes from gravitationally-driven to advectively-driven as submesoscale dynamics become more important. The vertical velocity associated with submesoscale dynamics enhances the contribution of slower-sinking particles to POC export. A steeper particle size spectrum, also increases the contribution of smaller, slower-sinking particles. Implementing a remineralization scheme generally decreases the total amount of biomass exported, but its impact is weaker in dynamical regimes where submesoscale dynamics are present and export is advectively-driven. Under specific conditions, remineralization processes counter-intuitively enhance the role of slower-sinking particles to the point where these slower-sinking velocity classes dominate the export, therefore challenging the traditional paradigm for POC export. This study demonstrates that slow-sinking particles can be a significant contribution, and at times, even dominate the export flux.

%{\color{red} NOTE: Following Roo's suggestion, I looked at the spectrum of biomass per velocity class vs time to see how it evolves. As Melissa suggested, it will be cool to include into a presentation, but I don't think it is worth including in the paper. I believe it would introduce too much additional concepts that would dilute the conclusions: the spectral shape is mostly determine by the pulse of particle crossing the export horizon. A constant reseeding of particles would be necessary to clearly put our point across using biomass spectra.}

\section{Introduction}

A major pathway transferring carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean is through photosynthesis and the production of Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) in the upper ocean. Sinking POC then allows the transfer of organic carbon from the upper ocean to the interior, leading to carbon sequestration over long time scales \citep{Falkowski_1998}. Understanding the mechanisms driving the export of POC from the ocean's surface to the interior is therefore crucial to better constrain Earth's carbon budget.

Traditionally, POC export is thought to be mainly driven by larger, faster-sinking, particles capable of gravitationally-sinking below the export depth over timescales shorter than remineralization timescales. This is a reasonable assumption if one considers that vertical advective velocities in the ocean are generally much weaker than velocities associated with gravitational sinking. However, recent work demonstrates that the presence of mesoscale eddies can enhance carbon export through two main processes: First, by increasing primary productivity through the injection of nutrients into the euphotic layer, therefore increasing the particle concentration, logically leading to a greater export \citep{Levy_1998}. Second, by generating larger vertical velocities along the front located at the eddy perimeter \citep{vanHaren_2006, Waite_2016}. These studies demonstrate that ocean dynamics potentially play an important role in driving the carbon export from the euphotic layer to the ocean interior. This conclusion is further supported by a recent, yet large, body of literature focusing on ocean dynamics at submeso-scales (1-10 km) and the impact on biogeochemical processes \citep[see reviews in][]{Thomas_2008,Klein_2009,Mahadevan_2016}. Submesoscale dynamics, characterized by Rossby numbers of order 1, typically develop in filaments in areas where sharp density fronts exist \citep{McWilliams_2016}. In this dynamical regime, geostrophic balance fails and a secondary ageostrophic circulation develops across the front, capable of generating large vertical velocities on the order of 100 m/day \citep{FoxKemper_2008,Mahadevan_2016}. On the denser side of the front, the vorticity is cyclonic and associated with downwelling velocities, while anticyclonic vorticity and upwelling is expected on the lighter side of the front. The distribution of relative vorticity across a front is asymmetric and skewed toward cyclonic vorticity \citep{Rudnick_2001}, leading to more localized and more intense downwelling regions, as opposed to weaker and larger upwelling regions \citep{Mahadevan_2006}. Just like at meso-scales, enhanced vertical velocities can generate either a local bloom by supplying nutrients to the sunlit layer of the ocean \citep{Mahadevan_2012}, or can significantly increase the export of POC to the ocean interior \citep{Levy_2012, Estapa_2015,Omand_2015}. 

The downwelling velocities $\mathcal{O}$(100 m/day) generated at submeso-scales provide a physical mechanism capable of competing with gravitational sinking and thus exporting particles over a larger portion of the particle size spectrum. Through this mechanism, smaller particles can efficiently be exported over timescales shorter than their remineralization timescales, despite their slower sinking velocities. Considering the fact that, although containing less biomass per particle, smaller particles are far more numerous than larger particles, the impact of submesoscale dynamics on the export of POC is potentially significant. Submesoscale processes are, by definition, associated with spatial scales $\mathcal{O}$(1 km) and time scales $\mathcal{O}$(1 day), which makes it difficult to observe in-situ. Additionally, and despite recent methodological progress \citep{McDonnell_2010}, direct measurements of particles sinking velocities are difficult to obtain, and are more often than not inferred from key parameters such as particle type, size, and density.

In this study, we therefore rely on a submesoscale-resolving non-hydrostatic model coupled with a particle-tracking module to explore the necessary conditions for slow-sinking particles to significantly contribute to carbon export, as a function of (1) the dynamics of the flow field, (2) the slope of the sinking velocity spectrum, and (3) the remineralization timescale. Particles in the model are prescribed with both a constant and time-varying sinking velocity to mimic a remineralizing behavior. Particles are released in two fundamentally different flow fields in terms of dynamics based on observed conditions in the Northeast Pacific in the summer, where ocean dynamics are characterized by low Rossby numbers and weak vertical advective velocities, and in the winter, where ocean dynamics include submesoscale frontal structures and local Rossby numbers $\mathcal{O}$(1). Both simulations and the particle-tracking module are described in Section \ref{sec: Methods}. The impact of particles characteristics and ocean dynamics on the export of POC is quantified in Section \ref{sec: Results}, and discussed in Section \ref{sec: Discussion}. Section \ref{sec: Conclusions} summarizes the key conclusions of the study.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec: Methods}
\subsection{Model setup and domain}

This study uses a non-hydrostatic, three-dimensional, numerical model called PSOM \citep{Mahadevan_1996a,Mahadevan_1996b}. To simulate an eddy field that is representative of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the model domain is set in a channel configuration with periodic east-west boundaries, and solid boundaries in the south and north. The domain covers 112 km in the x-direction, 304 km in the y-direction, and 1000 m in the vertical (Figure \ref{fig: model_domain}). The horizontal resolution is 500 m, while a stretched grid is used in the vertical with 32 levels ranging in thickness from 1.25 m near the surface to 70 m at the lowermost level. The model is integrated numerically in time and evolves the temperature, salinity, free-surface height, pressure, and three-dimensional velocity field from an initial state, subject to momentum and buoyancy fluxes applied through the surface boundary conditions.

(c) Surface net heat flux anomaly superimposed to the heat fluxes prescribed at $y = 150$ km.}
	\label{fig: model_domain}
\end{figure}

Time-varying wind stress and heat flux are prescribed at the surface boundary. Time series are computed from measurements collected at Station Papa and available through the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. Daily wind stress and net heat fluxes are calculated over the period 2007-2016 to produce a year-long climatology. A squared low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 8.5 days is applied to both time series to remove high-frequency variability. In all numerical experiments, the simulations are first allowed to spin-down for the first 5 days with no forcing applied at the surface boundary. Surface wind stress and heat fluxes are then linearly ramped up between days 5 and 10 of the simulation, to reach realistic values at day 10. % (Figures \ref{fig: Papa_summer} and \ref{fig: Papa_winter}).
While the meriodional component, $\tau_y$, is set to zero, the zonal component of the wind stress, $\tau_x$, is prescribed at the surface throughout the model domain and is tapered at the northern and southern boundaries to avoid excessive Ekman-driven upwelling and downwelling %that could contaminate the middle third of the model domain, where the analysis is focused 
(Figure \ref{fig: model_domain}a). A restoration timescale is prescribed to contain the curl-driven upwelling and downwelling regions generated by the tapering of the wind stress, as well as to limit internal wave reflection at the solid boundaries back into the domain (Figure \ref{fig: model_domain}b). While net surface heat fluxes are homogeneous in the zonal direction, a meridional gradient is maintained throughout the simulation. The meridional gradient was determined from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) product \citep{Mesinger_2006}, and set to 1/24 W/m$^2$/km (Figure \ref{fig: model_domain}c).

Initial hydrographic conditions are determined from a three-dimensional gridded field of temperature and salinity from Argo floats \citep{Gaillard_2009,Gaillard_2016}. Argo data is averaged monthly over the period 2002-2012 and two different months are used to initialize the two main numerical experiments for this study: Climatological conditions in April are used to initialize the \textit{Papa\_summer} experiment, while January climatological conditions are used to initialize the \textit{Papa\_winter} experiment (Table \ref{tab: meso_vs_submeso}). The north-south background density gradient is then intensified into three fronts located at $y = 75$, $y = 150$, and $y = 225$ km (Figure \ref{fig: model_domain}). The amplitude of the density gradient associated with the three fronts is determined from the probability distribution function (PDF) of the density gradients measured by underwater gliders deployed around Station Papa over the period 2008-2010 \citep{Pelland_2016}. To reduce model spin-up time, density fronts are perturbed by a sinusoidal wave with a wavelength close to the 1st baroclinic deformation radius ($\lambda = $ 66 km). Similar PSOM configurations were successfully used in previous studies \citep{Mahadevan_2012,Omand_2015}.

Two main experiments are conducted using the same configuration of PSOM, where only initial conditions and surface forcings are varied: \textit{Papa\_summer} aims at generating ocean dynamics representing conditions in the northeast Pacific in the summertime. Summer ocean dynamics are characterized by a flow generally in geostrophic balance, with relatively weak density gradients and low Rossby numbers ($\ll$1). \textit{Papa\_winter} aims at capturing wintertime ocean conditions in the region. A different dynamical regime is expected to dominate during wintertime when mixed layers are deeper and lateral density gradients enhanced, with sharper density fronts, filament-like features and localized Rossby number $\mathcal{O}$(1) over spatial scales $\mathcal{O}$(1 km) \citep{Mensa_2013,Callies_2015,Thompson_2016}. The individual characteristics of each of \textit{Papa\_summer} and \textit{Papa\_winter} are detailed below.

\subsubsection{\textit{Papa\_summer} Model Experiment}

In \textit{Papa\_summer}, PSOM is initialized based on climatological Argo data in April. The magnitude of the density gradient across the front is set to 3.34$\times$10$^{-6}$ kg/m$^3$/m, which corresponds to the 95$^{th}$ percentile of the PDF of density gradients measured in April from glider data collected in the region (Figure \ref{fig: Papa_summer} and Table \ref{tab: meso_vs_submeso}). The model is run with a timestep of 216 s and is allowed to spin-up for 60 days, allowing summer stratification to develop. The model is then run for 30 additional days, saving instantaneous model fields every 3 hours for particle tracking. The month of April is chosen for initialization so the experiment would capture the onset of positive net heat fluxes, and the summer restratification that ensues in July-August (Figure \ref{fig: Papa_summer}). In this region, the summer stratification is associated with large primary productivity, particle production, and POC export \citep[e.g., fecal pellets, dead phytoplankter; ][]{Plant_2016}.

\subsubsection{\textit{Papa\_winter} Model Experiment}

In \textit{Papa\_winter}, PSOM is initialized based on climatological Argo data in January. The frontal gradient is set to 3.54$\times$10$^{-5}$ kg/m$^3$/m, which corresponds to the 99$^{th}$ percentile of the PDF of density gradients measured in January from glider data collected in the region (Figure \ref{fig: Papa_winter} and Table \ref{tab: meso_vs_submeso}). The model is allowed to spin-up for 50 days allowing for the prescribed fronts to become unstable. To accommodate for the larger density gradients and stronger velocities, the advective timestep is shortened to 108 s and the horizontal diffusivity is lowered to 0.2 m$^2$/s throughout the experiment. The model is run for 30 additional days, saving instantaneous model fields every 1.5 hours for particle tracking. The month of January is chosen for initialization so the experiment would capture the time of year where the mixed layer is the deepest, and Rossby number O(1) occur more frequently. The objective is for this experiment to contrast \textit{Papa\_summer} by capturing the statistics of ocean conditions dominated by submesoscale dynamics.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Validation}
\label{sec: glider_validation}

To ensure that PSOM simulations yielded realistic conditions for both \textit{Papa\_summer} and \textit{Papa\_winter}, distributions of horizontal ($M^2$) and vertical ($N^2$) buoyancy gradients are compared with glider observations collected over the period 2008-2009 \citep{Pelland_2016}.
During this period, underwater gliders sampled in a ``bow-tie" pattern centered on Station Papa. Gliders sample the water column in a triangular wave pattern, whose shape is easily affected by currents, due to the slow moving speed of the glider ($\sim$1 km/hr). It is therefore challenging to associate a specific spatial scale with gradients computed between glider profiles, as profile separation distances can be highly variable through depth and time. To circumvent this issue, horizontal buoyancy gradients are computed between each pair of glider profiles available within one branch of the bow-tie. Each along-track lateral buoyancy gradient is thus associated with a specific separation scale and a timestamp. Glider-based density gradients can be affected by internal waves. To filter the impact of internal waves on the PDF of horizontal buoyancy gradients, only gradients computed at a scale of twice the Rossby radius $\pm$ 1 km are considered. Rossby radii are estimated from the glider data and are $\sim8$ km in winter and $\sim20$ km in summer.
 
\subsection{Particle Tracking Experiments}

\subsubsection{Particle Advective Scheme}
To quantify the impact of submesoscale dynamics on the export of Particulate Organic Matter (POC), Lagrangian particle tracking is used in conjunction with the flow field obtained from the two experiments described above. Particles are tracked using the non-divergent velocity field at each face of a grid cell. The velocity field is then linearly interpolated onto the particle's position. For example, the eastward velocity (x-axis) of a particle is given by:

\begin{equation}
u(x) = u_{i-1} + \frac{(x - x_{i-1})}{(x_i - x_{i-1})}(u_{i}-u_{i-1})
\end{equation}
where the subscripts $i-1$ and $i$ denote the western and eastern walls of the grid cell where the particle is located, respectively. This can be re-written as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \beta x + \delta =  0
\label{eq: eq_diff}
\end{equation}
where $\beta = (u_{i}-u_{i-1})/\Delta x$ and $\delta = -u_{i-1} - \beta x_{i-1}$ \citep{Doos_2013}. This differential equation can be solved analytically for $\beta \neq 0$:

\begin{equation}
x_{t_1} = \left(x_0 + \frac{\delta}{\beta}\right)\exp^{-\beta(t_1 - t_0)} - \frac{\delta}{\beta}
\label{eq: PT_advection}
\end{equation}
The time it will take for the particle to reach the eastern or western face of the grid cell can be computed by taking $x_{t_1} = x_i$ or $x_{t_1} = x_{i-1}$, respectively, and solving for $t_1$. For each advective timestep, the times required for the particle to reach any of the 6 walls of the grid cell are computed using (\ref{eq: PT_advection}). If any of those times is shorter than the advective timestep, the particle is advected until it reaches the cell wall. Then the flow field in the adjacent grid cell is considered and the particle is advected over the remaining time. 

\subsubsection{Particle Seeding}

For all particle-tracking experiments, a single particle seeding event is prescribed. In the horizontal, particles are seeded every 250 m over the entire domain in the x-direction, and for 100 $<y<$ 200 km in the y-direction. The seeding is centered over the mean position of the middle front (see Figure \ref{fig: Papa_summer}) and is therefore not affected by undesired effects created by the solid north-south solid boundaries. In the vertical, particles are seeded every 1 m between 75 and 85 m. This depth range is chosen as it corresponds to the average euphotic depth at Station Papa, defined by the 1\% light level. The euphotic depth was computed for the months of February and June over the period 2007-2016 from profiles of Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR) collected at Station Papa as part of the long-term monitoring of Line P executed by the Department of Fisheries and Ocean Canada\footnote{https://www.waterproperties.ca/linep/index.php}. The average euphotic depth computed for both of these months is around 80 m, which agrees with previously established estimates of the euphotic depth \citep{Sherry_1999,Harrison_2004}.

In each particle-tracking experiment, four different classes of particles are released. Each particle class is characterized by a different sinking velocity: 0.025, 0.05, 1, and 5 m/day. The slowest-sinking class is essentially selected to represent non-sinking particles: based on the setup of our experiments, the slowest-sinking particles would take 800 days on average to be exported to a depth of 100 m through gravitational sinking, a timescale much greater than commonly observed remineralization timescales. The fastest-sinking velocity is chosen as a low end-member representing velocity classes that will be exported in its entirety over the course of our experiment. The results presented for the 5 m/day sinking class can therefore be extrapolated to any class with a higher sinking velocity.

The advective timestep for particles is set to 1.5 hours. The flow field is linearly interpolated in time between model outputs, justifying the higher temporal resolution used for particle tracking in \textit{Papa\_winter}. Particle positions are saved every 3 hours, along with key model variables interpolated onto the particle positions (e.g., density, vorticity). Particles are tracked for three weeks (28 days). Each particle-tracking experiment contains 1,971,717 particles per sinking-velocity class, for a total of 9,858,585 particles. Particles located deeper that the maximum winter mixed layer \citep[i.e., 100 m;][]{Pelland_2016, Plant_2016} are considered exported, as they will likely not be re-entrained into the mixed layer. %The export horizon is therefore set to 100 m, based on the seasonal cycle observed at Station Papa \citep{Pelland_2016}.

\subsubsection{Density and Biomass Spectra}
\label{sec: equations_biomass}
The slope of the size spectrum of particles is traditionally described by the slope of the log-log curve, $\xi$, between particle number $N$ and particle radius $r$ \citep[also know as the Junge slope;][]{White_2015}:

\begin{equation}
N(r) = N_0 \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{-\xi}
\label{eq: powerlaw_radius}
\end{equation}
where $N_0$ and $r_0$ represent a reference particle number and radius, chosen arbitrarily. For small particles ($<$400 $\mu$m) and relatively low temperature ($<$15$^o$C), it has been shown that the relationship between particle radius $r$ and sinking velocity $w_s$ exhibits a range of variation and is difficult to determine empirically. Nevertheless, Stokes' law, where $w_s \propto r^2$, is often used as a lower-bound sinking velocity estimate \citep{Bach_2012}. %\cite{Bach_2012} also demonstrate that Stokes law is generally a lower-bound estimate of sinking velocities for a specific particle size. 
Assuming a Stokes-like relationship, we can construct a particle sinking velocity spectrum $N(w_s)$ based on (\ref{eq: powerlaw_radius}), where $w_{s_0}$ is the sinking speed of particles with a radius $r_0$:

\begin{equation}
N(w_s) = N_0 \left(\frac{w_s}{w_{s_0}}\right)^{-\xi/2}
\label{eq: powerlaw_velocity}
\end{equation}
For a specific slope and sinking-velocity class, an equivalent number of particles per simulated particle can thus be computed using (\ref{eq: powerlaw_velocity}) (See Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}). For example, using the largest sinking velocity class as a reference (i,.e., $w_{s_0} = 5$ m/day and $N_0=$1,971,717), and a spectral slope $\xi = 4$, each simulated particle with a sinking velocity of 0.025 m/day in fact represent 40,000 particles (Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}). The relative biomass of a particle in a specific sinking-velocity class, $B_p(w_s)$, can be estimated if the biomass is assumed to scale with the particle's volume. The relative biomass of one particle in a sinking-velocity class $w_s$ can therefore be computed using:

	\label{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
	B_p(w_s) = B_p(w_{s_0})\left(\frac{w_s}{w_{s_0}}\right)^{3/2}
	\label{eq: biomass_realparticle}
\end{equation}
where $B_p(w_{s_0})$ is the biomass of a particle in the sinking velocity class $w_{s_0}$. The total biomass associated with one simulated particle can be obtained by scaling (\ref{eq: biomass_realparticle}) by the ratio $N(w_s)/N_0$:

\begin{equation}
	B(w_s) =  B_0\left(\frac{w_s}{w_{s_0}}\right)^{3/2}\frac{N(w_s)}{N_0}
	\label{eq: biomass_simulatedparticle}
\end{equation}
where $B_0 = B_p(w_{s_0})$. Combining (\ref{eq: powerlaw_velocity}) and (\ref{eq: biomass_simulatedparticle}) yields an expression relating the biomass associated with a simulated particle for a specific sinking-velocity class and the spectral slope (Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}):
\begin{equation}
	B(w_s) = B_0\left(\frac{w_s}{w_{s_0}}\right)^{\frac{3-\xi}{2}}
	\label{eq: biomassjungeslope}
\end{equation}
Using the same example as before where $\xi = 4$, if the amount of biomass associated with one simulated particle in the 5 m/day sinking-velocity class is taken as $B_0 = 1$, then one simulated particle sinking at 0.025 m/day contains 14.14 units of biomass and a single particle contains $14.14/40,000 =3.5\times10^{-4}$ units of biomass (see Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}). This normalized formulation of particle number and biomass (see Equations (\ref{eq: powerlaw_velocity}) and (\ref{eq: biomassjungeslope})) has the advantage that the impact of spectral slope on the relative export of biomass can be quantified without needing a large number of particle-tracking experiments, where the number of seeded particles would vary to account for the different spectral slopes. For the purpose of this study, only the relative amount of biomass is relevant. For simplicity, we therefore define a normalized biomass unit as $B_0=$ 1.

\subsubsection{Particle Remineralization Scheme}
\label{sec: remin_scheme}
Remineralization of particles as they sink through the water column impacts the amount of biomass exported. Slow-sinking particles generally contains less biomass and spends more time in the mixed layer, which means that they are remineralized at a shallower depth than faster sinking particles. Remineralization processes are complex, species-dependent, and generally not well-understood. In the absence of a consensus on a general functional form of particle remineralization, we rely on an idealized relationship which assumes that the biomass content of a particle decreases in time proportionally to the particle volume. Remineralization is thus modeled as an exponential decrease of biomass with time at a rate $k$ \citep{Iversen_2010, Iversen_2013}:
\begin{equation}
	B (t) = B^0\exp(-kt)
	\label{eq: remin_scheme}
\end{equation}
where $B^0$ denotes the biomass content at $t = 0$ days, and the remineralization rate is taken to be $k = 0.13$ day$^{-1}$ in this study \citep{Iversen_2010}. This remineralization rate is independent of particle sinking velocity, and seems to lie within the range of other estimates \citep{Ploug_2008, Iversen_2010, Iversen_2013}. The change in biomass with time is in turn expected to affect the sinking velocity of the particle. Given that $B \propto w^{3/2}$ (see Equation (\ref{eq: biomass_realparticle})), particles in all sinking-velocity classes undergo a decay in sinking speed according to:

\begin{equation}
w_s (t) = w_s^0\exp(-\frac{2kt}{3})
\label{eq: sinking_velocity_remin}
\end{equation}
where $w_s^0$ is the initial sinking velocity at $t = 0$ days. In this study, the impact of remineralization is thus considered through the implementation of a time-dependent sinking velocity (Equation \ref{eq: sinking_velocity_remin}). While particles classes are classified based on their initial sinking-velocity, it is worth noting that over the length of the particle-tracking experiments that include remineralization (28 days), particle sinking speeds slow down to 10\% of their initial velocity, which correspond to 3.1\5.

\section{Results}
\label{sec: Results}
\subsection{Seasonally varying dynamical regimes}

Two model experiments are designed to capture different dynamical conditions observed in the northeast Pacific Ocean in summer and winter. \textit{Papa\_summer} is initialized in early spring (doy 105) when the water column is characterized by a relatively deep mixed layer ($\sim$100 m) and a halocline located between 100 and 150 m (Figure \ref{fig: Papa_summer}). The forcing by a realistic, positive, net heat flux generates the restratification of the water column, with the development of a strong thermocline between 25 and 50~m leading to the shoaling of the mixed layer and a subsurface peak in $N^2$ at about 30 m (see Figure \ref{fig: Papa_summer}). A comparison between model outputs and monthly-averaged density profiles from underwater gliders collected in June and July over the period 2008-2009 yields correlation coefficients of $r = 0.87$ and $r = 0.88$, respectively. These high correlation suggest that \textit{Papa\_summer} numerical experiment captures the vertical spring and summer conditions in the northeast Pacific Ocean.

In the horizontal, the prescribed density fronts progressively become unstable within the first 60 days of the experiment (Figure \ref{fig: Papa_summer}). During this time, the Total Kinetic Energy (KE$_{\text{tot}}$) contained in the model domain slowly increases before reaching a maximum at doy 162, where it remains relatively constant for the rest of the simulation. The flattening of the KE$_{\text{tot}}$ curve is used to determine the time necessary for the simulation to spin-up, hence determining the start day of the particle-tracking experiments. The ocean dynamics associated with \textit{Papa\_summer} are characterized using PDFs of horizontal buoyancy gradients ($M^2 = |\nabla_Hb|^2$), vertical velocities ($w$), and Rossby numbers computed from the normalized vertical component of the relative vorticity (Ro $=(v_x - u_y)/f$ where f = 1.12$\times10^{-4}$; Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}).

\end{figure}

%The largest horizontal buoyancy gradients are observed above the thermocline ($z$$<$50 m) and along the halocline (100--200 m), and range between 0 and 1.2$\times 10^{-7}$ s$^{-2}$ (Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}). 
Lateral buoyancy gradients in the summer are relatively weak $\mathcal{O}$(10$^{-8}$ s$^{-2}$) and result in low Rossby numbers $\mathcal{O}$(0.1), with positive relative vorticity on the denser (north) side of the front and negative relative vorticity on the lighter (south) side of the front. Corresponding vertical velocities are consistently weaker than 1 m/day ($<$10$^{-5}$ m/s) and are characterized by regions of weak upwelling and downwelling on 10 km scales, associated with the meandering of the front \citep{Bower_1989}. Alternating bands of upwelling and downwelling at $\mathcal{O}$(1 km) spatial scale are superimposed, and likely caused by propagating internal waves. Coherent vertical velocities structures extend to depths much greater than the mixed layer depth ($\sim$25 m; Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}). The amplitude of the vertical velocity field coincides with the expected order of magnitude given by the scaling $w \propto RofU/N$ \citep{Mahadevan_2016}: using $Ro\sim0.1$ (Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}), $N\sim10^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig: Papa_summer}), $f\sim10^{-5}$ s$^{-1}$, and $U\sim0.01$ m/s, we obtain $w\sim 10^{-6}$ m/s, or $\sim 10^{-1}$ m/day. %The agreement between the scaling and the model outputs suggest that PSOM is capable of reproducing a realistic vertical flow field.

\textit{Papa\_winter} is, on the other hand, initialized in the winter (doy 0) to capture a time period where the mixed layer depth is deeper ($\sim$ 100 m) and density gradients more pronounced \citep{Pelland_2016}. At this time of year, the water column in this region is characterized by the presence of a deep halocline between 100 and 150 m \citep[Figure \ref{fig: Papa_winter}][]{Pelland_2016}. After spin-up, the vertical stratification remains consistent throughout the model run, and compares well with the vertical profile obtained from glider observations for the month of March ($r = 0.95$; see Figure \ref{fig: Papa_winter}). In the horizontal, prescribed density fronts are much sharper than in summer (i.e., over smaller spatial scales O(1 km ) vs. O(10 km)). Because of these stronger density gradients, combined with the alternating zonal winds and constantly negative surface heat flux, the fronts become unstable more rapidly than in summer (Figure \ref{fig: Papa_winter}). As a result, KE$_{\text{tot}}$ starts to plateau at doy 48. The experiment is considered spun-up by doy 50 and the particle-tracking experiment is initialized. %Many sharp fronts and filaments on the order of 1 km can be seen in \textit{Papa\_winter}, penetrating to ocean upper layer to the deeper than in the summer, dissipating within the mixed layer at $\sim$100 m (Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}). 

The frontal structures visible in the horizontal buoyancy gradient field are associated with filaments of relatively high Rossby number of $\mathcal{O}$(1) (Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}). The PDF of relative vorticity reveals a positively-skewed distribution ($s = 0.68$). This is in agreement with the fact the relative vorticity is more likely to be cyclonic than anticyclonic, based on conservation of potential vorticity \citep{Hoskins_1972}. Regions with a high Rossby number are localized and located in the mixed layer exclusively. In places where the local Rossby number reaches $\mathcal{O}$(1), geostrophic balance is lost and a vertical secondary ageostrophic circulation begins to slump the isopycnals and restore the flow to a more geostrophically-balanced flow. This ageostrophic secondary circulation therefore generates ``hot spots" of higher vertical velocities. The fine-scale structures in the vertical velocity field corresponding to $\mathcal{O}$(1) Rossby numbers  can be seen in Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}, with local vertical velocities up to 60 m/day ($\sim 7\times10^{-4}$ m/s). Contrary to the PDF of relative vorticity, the distribution of vertical velocities demonstrate a negative skewness ($s =$ -0.25). This is in agreement with the theory: In fact, positive relative vorticity is associated with the dense side of a density front, where vertical velocities are negative \citep{Mahadevan_2016}. Once again, the amplitude of these vertical velocity hot spots is coherent with the scaling $w \propto RofU/N$: using $Ro\sim1$, $N\sim10^{-2}$ 1/s, $f\sim10^{-5}$ 1/s, and $U\sim0.1$ m/s, we obtain $w\sim 10^{-4}$ m/s, or $\sim 10^{1}$ m/day. %This demonstrates the capabilities of PSOM to resolve sharp frontal features at the kilometer scale, as well as the ageostrophic circulation associated with those fronts. 

Comparing \textit{Papa\_summer} and \textit{Papa\_winter} highlights the different dynamical regimes in the two experiments. In \textit{Papa\_winter}, density fronts tend to be sharper, meaning larger density gradients over shorter spatial scales. When computed at the kilometer-scale, the PDF of horizontal buoyancy gradients in \textit{Papa\_winter} exhibits a longer tail than in \textit{Papa\_summer} (Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}). When compared to observations, the PDFs of $M^2$ in \textit{Papa\_summer} and \textit{Papa\_winter} demonstrate a correlation with observations of $r = 0.93$ and $r = 0.95$, respectively


The wider PDF of vertical velocities in \textit{Papa\_winter} shows advective velocities that match and exceed typical gravitational sinking velocities, particularly for smaller, and therefore slower-sinking, particulate organic material. The secondary ageostrophic circulation that develops at submeso-scales (i.e., Ro O(1)) therefore generates an export mechanism that directly competes with the traditional paradigm that relies on gravitational sinking leading the export of particulate matter in the ocean.

\subsection{Gravitational and Advective Sinking of POC}

Both model experiments described above were then used to investigate the relationship between ocean dynamics and particle downward flux, using Lagrangian particle-tracking. Downward particle flux is expected to be a combination of their sinking velocity and the vertical advective currents affecting the particle along its pathway. The deviation in particle depths from the traditional one-dimensional gravitationally driven model is shown in Figure \ref{fig: particle_depth_distribution}d for both summer and winter cases. In the summer, the PDF of particle density versus depth remains relatively narrow through time, and is centered on a depth level that can be predicted using a simple 1D gravitational model (see shaded curves in Figure \ref{fig: particle_depth_distribution}). PDFs of particle density also vary little among particles classes with different sinking velocities, suggesting that downward fluxes of particles is greatly dominated by gravitational settling and is not subject to significant vertical ocean currents.

	\label{fig: particle_depth_distribution}
\end{figure}

In the winter, however, the PDF of particle density versus depth is wider, in agreement with the stronger vertical ocean currents occurring in the winter (see Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}). The deviation in the downward particle flux from the traditionally considered 1D gravitational model can be seen in Figure \ref{fig: particle_depth_distribution} (panels (a)-(c)). Slower-sinking particles deviate more than faster-sinking particles, exhibiting median depth anomalies up to 50 m. This is due to the fact that slower-sinking particles spend more time in the mixed layer, where most of the stronger vertical currents tend to occur (Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}). An interesting result emerges from the spatial distribution of the depth-anomaly: both positive (where particles are shallower than expected) and negative (particles are deeper than expected) anomalies are organized into features with a length-scale $\mathcal{O}$(1-10 km). This further highlights the importance of winter submesoscale circulation for vertical fluxes of particles and their associated .%, which is explicitly shown in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}.

A relative amount of biomass is associated to the particles using equation \ref{eq: biomassjungeslope}. The PDF of relative biomass as a function of the vertical velocity is shown in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}. Following the traditional paradigm derived from the simple 1D gravitational model, the downward flux of biomass in the summer is dominated by faster-sinking particle classes capable of carrying particulate material downwards more efficiently. The contribution of slower-sinking particles, however, critically depends on the slope of the size spectrum (see Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}). As the Junge slope increases, the spectrum of biomass steepens, and the relative contribution of slower-sinking particles to the downward biomass flux significantly increases. In fact, the contribution of slower-sinking particles to the summer downward flux increases by a factor 100 (from 0.1\% to 10\%) when the Junge slope varies from $\xi =2$ to $\xi = 4$. While significant, the impact of a change in the Junge slope in summer conditions does not challenge the dominant role played by faster-sinking particles. This result can be explained by the fact that, in the summer, vertical velocities are weak and vertical biomass fluxes are therefore gravitationally-driven.

Biomass export flux for the 5 m/day sinking-velocity class remains unchanged, as it is used as a reference class in Equation (\ref{eq: biomassjungeslope}) ($w_{s_0} = 5$ m/day).}

Both winter dynamics and steeper Junge slopes tend to increase the relative contribution of slower-sinking particles.}
	\label{fig: biomass_export}
\end{figure}

In the winter, the PDFs of relative biomass as a function of vertical velocities present a much larger spread, with velocity magnitudes exceeding 50 m/day. For $\xi = 2$, the relative contribution of slower-sinking particles to the downward flux significantly increases from 0.1\% in the summer to about 4\% in the winter, demonstrating the impact advective velocities alone can have on vertical fluxes. Nevertheless, slower-sinking particles remain a relatively small contributor to the total downward flux of biomass. When winter ocean dynamics are coupled with a steeper Junge slope, however, slower-sinking particles largely dominate the downward biomass flux. In our winter simulations with $\xi = 4$, we find that the slowest-sinking particle class is responsible for about 80\% of the biomass flux.

 %In this study, particles are considered ``exported" once transported below the depth of the winter mixed layer, which roughly corresponds to the 100 m depth horizon at Station Papa. Choosing the winter mixed layer as the export depth is most appropriate compared to other commonly chosen depth horizons (e.g., compensation depth, euphotic depth, etc.), as it reduces the chances of particles being re-entrained into the mixed layer the following winter \citep{Palevsky_2016,Palevsky_2018}. We first consider the case of conservative particles that do not remineralize in order to isolate the effects of ocean dynamics on export.

%The domain-integrated flux of simulated particles crossing the 100 m export horizon, normalized by the total number of particles in each class (N = 1,971,717), is shown in Figure \ref{fig: particle_export} for both \textit{Papa\_summer} and \textit{Papa\_winter}. As expected, the faster-sinking particles are exported earlier than slower-sinking particles. For \textit{Papa\_summer} specifically, only the two fastest sinking-velocity classes (5 and 1 m/day) are exported within the first 28 days after seeding, while the other sinking-velocity classes do not significantly export particles over this time period ($<$ 5\%). In fact, time series of particle export flux closely follow the curves derived from considering gravitational sinking only (Figure \ref{fig: particle_export}a). The particle flux is therefore exclusively downward, as the sinking rate of the particles in these sinking-velocity classes are larger than the advective sinking velocity ($w_s > w_{flow}$; see Figure \ref{fig: dynamics}).

%\fixme{mention deviations from dashed line. Mention resuspension (less than 1\%) for slow-sinking particles only due to vertical velocities.}
%The percentage of simulated particles crossing the 100 m export horizon with time is shown in Figure \ref{fig: particle_export} for both \textit{Papa\_summer} and \textit{Papa\_winter}. As expected, the faster-sinking particles are exported earlier and in larger proportions. For \textit{Papa\_summer} specifically, only the two fastest sinking-velocity classes (5 and 1 m/day) are exported within the first 28 days after seeding, while the other sinking-velocity classes do not significantly export particles over this time period ($<$ 5\%). In fact, time series of exported particles closely follow the curves derived from considering only gravitational sinking only (Figure \ref{fig: particle_export}).



%Time series of particle fluxes in \textit{Papa\_winter} present major differences (Figure \ref{fig: particle_export}b). In every sinking-velocity class, particles reach the export horizon faster than expected from gravitational sinking. This hastened arrival of particles is accentuated as the sinking-velocity decreases, ranging from about 1 day early for particles sinking at 5 m/day, to about 10 days early for particles sinking at a rate of 1 m/day. Sinking-velocity classes that are not expected to reach the export depth within the first 28 days now exhibit a significant net downward flux within the first 15 days of the simulation. For example, over 20\% of particles sinking at 0.5 m/day is cumulatively exported within the first 28 days in \textit{Papa\_winter}, versus less than 5\% in \textit{Papa\_summer}. However, particle export is now stretched over longer periods of time due to particle resuspension. In fact, the upward flux of particles in \textit{Papa\_winter} tends to mirror the measured downward flux (Figure \ref{fig: particle_export}b), exhibiting similar features such as the sudden increase in particle flux occurring at day 68 due to a wind impulse generating internal waves (see Figure \ref{fig: Papa_winter}a). These similarities suggest that advecting processes leading to an export flux are mostly reversible (e.g., internal waves, cyclo-geostrophy due to meandering jet). However, the net particle fluxes for all sinking-velocity classes remain generally downward, suggesting that some irreversible mechanisms are also occurring in the presence of submesoscale dynamics. %\fixme{do those irreversible pathways due to sinking out of the reversible pathway, or due to irreversible mechanisms?}

%The corresponding biomass export fluxes demonstrate that, in the presence of submesoscale dynamics, slow-sinking particles significantly contribute to the total export flux over timescales of days (Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}b). The quasi steady-state reached in the biomass export flux of the three slowest sinking-velocity classes suggests that biomass export is driven by advective processes rather than gravitational sinking ($w_s<w_{flow}$). However, the 5 m/day particle class still exhibits a peak in the biomass export flux coinciding with the peak expected from a simple one-dimensional gravitational sinking model, suggesting that the export for this sinking-velocity class remains mostly gravitationally-driven.

%As anticipated from Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}, the Junge slope $\xi$ is a determining parameter that affects the contribution of slower-sinking classes in the presence of submesoscale dynamics. Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export} shows the biomass export fluxes in normalized units for two different Junge slopes. The contribution from slow-sinking particles to the total biomass export flux expectedly decreases with the Junge slope. The decrease in biomass export flux is constant through time and can be predicted using Equation (\ref{eq: biomassjungeslope}):

%\begin{equation}
%    \frac{B_{\xi_1}(w_s)}{B_{\xi_2}(w_s)} = \left(\frac{w_s}{w_{s_0}}\right)^{\frac{\xi_2-\xi_1}{2}}
    %\frac{Flux\times B_{\xi_1}}{Flux\times B_{\xi_2}} = \frac{Flux \times B_0 \times \left(\frac{w_s}{w_s_0}\right)^{3-\xi_1/2}}{Flux \times B_0 \times \left(\frac{w_s}{w_s_0}\right)^{3-\xi_2/2}} = \left(\frac{w_s}{w_s_0}\right)^{(\xi_2-\xi_1)/2}
%\end{equation}
%Using $\xi_1 = 2$ and $\xi_2 = 4$, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}, the decrease in biomass export is 80\%, 90\%, and 99.5\% for the 1, 0.5 and 0.025 m/day particle classes, respectively. %\fixme{The evolution of the biological community through time that would affect the slope of the size spectrum also has direct consequences on the export of the slower-sinking particles.}

%The presence of submesoscale dynamics therefore both hastens particle export, and increases the number of exported slow-sinking particles, between a few percent and tens of percents, depending on the sinking-velocity class. This has large implications on the amount of biomass exported, as slower-sinking particles tend to be far more numerous than faster-sinking particles, despite containing less biomass per particle (i.e., $\xi >3$; see Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}). %While the particle flux is solely a function of the flow field, the exported biomass also depends on the Junge slope (see Equation (\ref{eq: biomassjungeslope})).

The impact of ocean dynamics on the respective contributions of the different sinking velocity classes to the total exported biomass is fairly intuitive: For a specific Junge slope, the presence of submesoscale dynamics enhances the role of slower-sinking particles in biomass export and decreases the importance of faster-sinking particles (dashed lines in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin}). This is a logical result given the observed increase in the particle export flux when submesoscale features are present (Figure \ref{fig: particle_export}). The sinking class dominating export, however, is highly dependent on the Junge slope. As the Junge slope increases, the particle spectrum steepens, and the contribution of slower-sinking particles to the total exported biomass increases. For example, after 28 days, the 1 m/day particle class cumulatively exported 50\%, 100\%, and 125\% of the biomass exported by the 5 m/day class when $\xi =$ 2, 3, and 4, respectively. However, slow-sinking particles are generally expected to remineralize on timescales shorter than their export timescale. The impacts of remineralization on export are considered in the following section.


 \subsection{Particle Remineralization}
 \label{sec: results_remin}
 
 Both ocean dynamics at submeso-scales and the Junge slope were identified as key factors impacting the respective role played by different particle classes in driving downward biomass fluxes. Simple Lagrangian particles were used to isolate the effects of these two factors. In reality, however, sinking velocities of particulate matter varies in time as the particles slowly remineralize. A remineralizing behavior was therefore implemented for the Lagrangian particles, using Equation \ref{eq: sinking_velocity_remin}, to investigate the impact that remineralization processes have on our findings. The traditional paradigm relies on the fact that slow-sinking particles tend to fully remineralize over shorter timescales, further enhancing the importance of faster-sinking particles classes in driving downward biomass fluxes. While this paradigm holds for flatter Junge slope, where the biomass content is dominated by faster-sinking particles, it becomes inadequate at steeper slopes. 
 
 Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin} shows the relative biomass and downward biomass fluxes associated with each of the modeled particle classes for $\xi = 4$ with and without remineralization processes. As expected, the main impact of implementing particle remineralization is a decrease in the total amount of biomass through time \fixme{refer to Fig 9?}. 
 
 During summertime and in the absence of remineralization, downward fluxes of biomass are dominated by faster-sinking particles, even for steeper Junge slope. This is due to the fact that the flux of biomass $\left<wB\right> = \left<w_sB\right> + \left<w_aB\right>$ is driven by $\left<w_sB\right>$, despite a smaller relative biomass content. This is characteristics of a gravitationally-driven system, where settling velocity dictates the contribution to downward fluxes. Implementing remineralization processes, however, directly affects the particle settling velocity which slows down as particles remineralize. This effect can be seen in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin}c, where the PDFs of relative biomass per particle class are centered over lower vertical velocities than in the absence of remineralization, as predicted by Equation \ref{eq: sinking_velocity_remin}. As a result, the gravitationally-driven term $\left<w_sB\right>$ becomes small, and the downward flux of biomass is generally advectively-driven. The advectively-driven component of the biomass fluxes is uniform across particle classes, as it only depends on ocean currents. Thus, in a advectively-driven system where $\left<w_sB\right> << \left<w_aB\right>$, the relative amount of biomass content in a particle class becomes important and dictates the respective contribution of each particle class to the total downward biomass fluxes. This shift from a gravitationally-driven to an advectively-driven system is observed when implementing particle remineralization in the summer (Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin}c): in the absence of remineralization, faster-sinking particles dominate the downward biomass fluxes (60\%; see Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin}a). When remineralization processes are considered, slower-sinking particles become the dominant contributor to biomass fluxes (see Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin}c). As shown in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}, downward biomass fluxes in the wintertime are generally advectively-driven, due to the larger vertical velocities associated with wintertime ocean dynamics. Even after implementing our remineralization scheme, slower-sinking particles remain the largest contributor to downward biomass fluxes. 
 
 These results highlight the importance in considering slower-sinking particle classes when considering downward biomass fluxes. It also demonstrates that, contrarily to the traditional paradigm, remineralization processes enhance the role played by slower-sinking particles in biomass fluxes, in cases where the biomass spectrum slope is negative. 
 
 The timescales over which the system transitioned from an gravitationally-driven to an advectively-driven system depends on the remineralization model used.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The impact of remineralization is three-fold: (1) it affects the total amount of biomass, as biomass is slowly remineralized - as illustrated by the decrease in area below the curves. (2) It shifts the PDFs of relative biomass as a function of vertical velocity towards slower vertical velocities. that is because, as they remineralize, the particles slow down. This has less of an impact on slower-sinking particles, as they are already sinking slowly anyway, so their PDFs don't change much, and the resulting downward biomass flux remains relatively large. faster-sinking particles, however, are more affected by the remineralization process, as their total vertical velocity shifts from gravitationally driven to advectively driven. as a result, their associated downward relative biomass flux is greatly decreased. Slow-sinking particles dominate the downward relative flux of biomass in both the summer and winter in the presence of remineralzation, as opposed to just the summer when remineralization is not included.
\end{itemize}
}

 %Including remineralization of particles significantly impacts the relative importance of sinking and advection to export for each particle class. In \textit{Papa\_summer}, particle export associated with a specific sinking-velocity class is delayed when remineralization is implemented, because particles decelerate as they are remineralized (see Equation (\ref{eq: sinking_velocity_remin}) and Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin}). In our simulations, particles sinking at 5 m/day reach the export horizon about 3 hours later when remineralization is included. The impact of remineralization intensifies as the sinking velocity weakens: particles sinking at 1 m/day reach the export horizon 9.5 days later when remineralization is implemented.
 


 %The biomass export flux is also reduced compared to the case with no remineralization. In a gravitationally-driven system such as during the summer in the northeast Pacific, captured in \textit{Papa\_summer}, the impact of remineralization on the amount of biomass exported grows as the sinking velocity decreases. In fact, in \textit{Papa\_summer} with no remineralization, several sinking-velocity classes contribute to the biomass export over different timescales (dash lines in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export_remin}). Once remineralization is implemented, no particles in the slowest sinking class (0.5 m/day) reach the export horizon and the contribution of the 1 m/day class is reduced by several orders of magnitude.
 
 %In \textit{Papa\_winter}, particles of all sinking-velocity classes tend to be exported over shorter timescales than in \textit{Papa\_summer} due to stronger vertical velocities (Figure \ref{fig: particle_export}). The difference in the biomass export flux between the cases with and without remineralization is therefore relatively small for the first 5 days of the time series, as particles have not had time to significantly remineralize yet but are already being exported. As particles age, remineralization has an increasing impact and the difference in the biomass export flux increases at a rate controlled by the remineralization rate defined in (\ref{eq: remin_scheme}). An interesting result to be noticed is the fact that, when $\xi = 4$ and remineralization is implemented, the biomass export flux of the 0.025 m/day sinking-velocity class exceeds the biomass export flux from both the 0.5 and 1 m/day sinking-velocity classes. This result only occurs when a negative slope of the biomass spectrum is combined with remineralization.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec: Discussion}

\subsection{Dynamical Regimes}
\label{sec: Discussion_model}
\textit{Papa\_summer} and \textit{Papa\_winter} experiments were designed to statistically capture the ocean dynamics at Station Papa (145$^o$W, 50$^o$N) in the northeast Pacific Ocean. After spin-up, the model demonstrated similar distribution of both horizontal ($M^2$) and vertical ($N^2$) density gradients to observations from underwater gliders (see Figures \ref{fig: Papa_summer}, \ref{fig: Papa_winter}, and \ref{fig: dynamics}). The two experiments, however, show significantly different distributions of $M^2$, with the winter distribution exhibiting a longer tail, suggesting sharper density gradients. The tail of the wintertime distribution is only partially captured by the glider data, due to the fact that underwater gliders sample gradients at a maximum resolution of about 10 km, while the model resolution is 500 m and therefore allows sharp submesoscale fronts and filaments to be captured in the distribution.

Studies investigating submesoscale dynamics traditionally focused on regions where the presence of submesoscale fronts and filaments are established, such as western boundary currents with strong gradients \citep{Dasaro_2011, Thomas_2013}, or at the edge of mesoscale features \citep{vanHaren_2006,Waite_2016}. The seasonality in submesoscale dynamics captured in the glider dataset at Station Papa, and reflected in the model experiments, echoes findings of recent observational studies conducted at a similar latitude in the Atlantic Ocean demonstrating the intensification of submesoscale dynamics in the wintertime \citep{Thompson_2016, Buckingham_2016}. Despite being sometimes qualified as an ``eddy desert" with low kinetic energy \citep{Chelton_2011}, ocean characteristics in the eastern part of the Pacific subpolar gyre suggest the presence of submesoscale features in the wintertime: strong density gradients, localized Rossby numbers of order 1, a balanced Richardson number $Ri_b = \frac{f^2N^2}{M^4}$ smaller than 1, a positively skewed distribution in vorticity, and a negatively skewed distribution of vertical velocities \citep[see Figure \ref{fig: dynamics};][]{Thomas_2008,Rudnick_2001, Buckingham_2016}.

Strong downward velocities are hypothesized to enhance POC export by advecting slower-sinking particles out of the mixed layer. \textit{Papa\_winter} indeed exhibits vertical velocities more than 20 times larger than in \textit{Papa\_summer}. The vertical currents in \textit{Papa\_winter}, however, tend to be much patchier than the weaker vertical currents observed in \textit{Papa\_summer}. Because both particle production and downward vertical velocities present a high degree of patchiness, it requires a certain level of covariance between the two fields for the export to effectively be enhanced \citep{Mahadevan_2012}. A more realistic seeding strategy for Lagrangian particles, such as one guided by biological tracers, would likely provide important information towards a better understanding of the effects of patchiness on POC export at submeso-scales

The hypothesis tested in this study is that submesoscale activity enhances export of particulate matter at Station Papa by shortening the export timescale of particulate matter. The wintertime intensification in submesoscale activity has the potential to indeed enhance export (see discussion in Section \ref{sec: discussion_particle}). However, the seasonal cycle in submesoscale activity is out of phase with the one in net community productivity, which peaks in the spring and summertime when the mixed layer is shallower \citep{Plant_2016}. Two mechanisms are therefore present to potentially sustain a year-long POC export flux: In the winter, less particulate material is present in the mixed layer, but active submesoscale dynamics tend to enhance the POC export flux by advecting the more numerous slower-sinking particles into the ocean interior. In the summer, the production of POC is at its yearly maximum, but export tends to be dominated by gravitational sinking, which favors faster-sinking particles and thus exclude part of the particle spectrum from contributing to the export flux.

\subsection{Particle export}
\label{sec: discussion_particle}

Analyses of particle tracking experiments reveal that the role played by slower-sinking particles in POC export depends on two main characteristics: (1) the dynamics of the ocean flow field, and (2) the slope of the size spectrum (i.e., the Junge slope $\xi$).

Mixed layer ocean dynamics at station Papa change significantly between the winter and the summer. In the winter, submesoscale dynamics are intensified, and sharp fronts and filaments develop in the mixed layer. This change in dynamics has a clear impact on the export flux of all sinking-velocity classes modeled in this experiment. Particle export within a sinking-velocity class is hastened and occur over longer timescales. In fact, particles tend to reach the export depth over shorter timescales than in the absence of submesoscale dynamics. This is maybe the most significant result, as export from any sinking-velocity class is characterized by two competing timescales: its export timescale and its remineralization timescale; The former evidently needing to be shorter than the latter to efficiently export POC. However, while some particles are exported faster, the rest of the particles within a sinking-velocity class are exported over longer timescales. This is due to upward vertical currents, re-suspending material that would otherwise sink, and thus delay its export (Figure \ref{fig: particle_export}). 

In the summer, the gravitationally-driven export mechanism efficiently exports faster-sinking particles, less numerous but generally richer in POC, and little to no slower-sinking particles. In the winter, however, the export mechanisms is advectively-driven, which leads to a slightly weaker export flux of faster-sinking particles than in the summer due to resuspension, but a much larger export flux of slower-sinking particles, which are present in far greater numbers (Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}). These two competing mechanisms raise the question as to which process is most efficient in exporting particulate material below the winter mixed layer.

%% This section answers the questions above in terms of total amount of biomass efficiently exported with and without remineralization 
In the absence of remineralization, the net effect of submesoscale dynamics on biomass export depends on the Junge slope coefficient (Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}). Over the course of our simulation, the biomass export flux is consistently enhanced when $\xi = 4$ in the presence of submesoscale dynamics. Therefore, export flux is only enhanced in the presence of submesoscale dynamics if the slope of the size spectrum is steep enough to compensate for the re-suspension of faster-sinking particles by upwards vertical currents at submesoscales. %Talk about the asymmetry in the vertical velocity PDF (see Figure \ref{fig: dynamics})? Showing stronger, more localized downwelling, and broader and weaker upwelling? 

Introducing remineralization processes significantly decreases the biomass export flux. Counter-intuitively, however, remineralization processes further strengthen the impact of submesoscale dynamics on export. The difference between summertime and wintertime biomass fluxes is even larger when remineralization processes are included. This can be explained by the fact that remineralization processes have a greater impact on sinking-velocity classes that rely on gravitational sinking to be exported, as remineralization tends to decelerate these particles and thus prolongs their export timescales. In the summer, almost the entirety of the sinking velocity spectrum is therefore affected as export is gravitationally-driven. In the winter, however, slower-sinking particles are exported through advective processes. Their export timescale is little affected by remineralization processes as it only depends on local ocean dynamics.

%% this part discusses the respective contributions of the different sinking-velocity classes
The contribution of a particle class to POC export generally increases with the sinking-velocity. That is, faster-sinking particles tend to dominate the export signal. However, this tendency can be reversed if the following condition is satisfied:

\begin{equation}
    N_{slow} > N_{fast} \times \left(\frac{w_{s_{fast}}}{w_{s_{slow}}}\right)^{\frac{3 - \xi}{2}}
    \label{eq: condition}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of simulated particles exported, $w_s$ is the sinking velocity and $\xi$ is the Junge slope coefficient (see Equation (\ref{eq: powerlaw_radius})). The number of exported slower-sinking particles must therefore be large enough to compensate for the smaller biomass content than faster-sinking particles. 

In a gravitationally-driven system (i.e., weak submesoscale activity), this can only be achieved by having  $N_{slow} \sim N_{fast}$ and $\xi>3$, as there are no mechanism capable of selectively exporting slower-sinking particles (i.e., $N_{slow} \leq N_{fast}$). Junge slopes greater than 3 are regularly observed in the ocean \citep{Kostadinov_2009, White_2015}. Our results suggest that, in these conditions, the export of biomass is dominated by an intermediate sinking-velocity class that sinks fast enough to be 100\% exported ($N_{slow} = N_{fast}$; see Figure \ref{fig: export_cartoon}a). Because of the negative slope in the biomass spectrum, the contribution to export of any particle class sinking at a faster rate will be smaller. The intermediate class responsible for the largest part of the export signal will vary with time and space as it depends on the parameter $\xi$, as well as on the export depth. As $\xi$ increases, the sinking-velocity of the dominant class decreases (see Equation (\ref{eq: condition})). A deeper export depth would have the opposite effect and increase sinking-velocity of the dominant class (Figure \ref{fig: export_cartoon}a). %Implementing remineralization processes only shifts the curve shown in Figure \ref{fig: export_cartoon}a towards faster-sinking classes: as particle remineralize, a larger portion of the sinking-velocity spectrum will not contribute to POC export, and a faster initial sinking-velocity is required for the export timescale to be shorter than the remineralization timescale.

	\label{fig: export_cartoon}
\end{figure}

In a system affected by submesoscale dynamics, localized strong downwelling vertical currents are generated. This effectively shortens the export timescale of slower-sinking particles, entering a regime where export timescales are shorter than remineralization timescales (Figure \ref{fig: export_cartoon}b). In this regime, slower-sinking particles significantly contribute to POC export, and can even dominate the export signal for large $\xi$. This scenario is captured in one of the Lagrangian experiment and shown in Figure \ref{fig: biomass_export}b, where the contribution to biomass export from the 0.025 m/day sinking class exceeds the one from the 0.5 m/day sinking class. This surprising result further emphasizes the key role played by slow-sinking particles in POC export, especially in the presence of submesoscale dynamics and large $\xi$.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: Conclusions}
The main conclusions of this study are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ocean dynamics in the subpolar Pacific northeast exhibit a seasonal cycle with low submesoscale activity in the summertime, and more submesoscale features in the wintertime. Submesoscale dynamics generate larger, and asymmetrical, vertical currents leading to an export mechanisms dominated by advective processes, as opposed to gravitationally-driven in the summertime.

\item Submesoscale dynamics generally enhance export by increasing the contribution of slower-sinking particles to POC export by increasing the number of particle exported through advective sinking. The contribution of slower-sinking particles subducted through irreversible ageostrophic processes to particle export is at least significant, and can be dominant in specific conditions.
\item Contribution of slower-sinking particles to POC export depends on the slope of the particle size spectra (i.e., Junge Slope), that controls the relative number of particles per size class. Three cases emerge in this study:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If the Junge slope is smaller than 3, larger particles contribute most to export independently of flow dynamics, as there are no mechanism capable of selectively exporting slower-sinking particles.
	\item If the Junge slope equals 3, the respective contributions of the different size classes depend on the dynamical characteristics of the flow, as it influences the number of particles being exported. If 100\% of particles is exported in all sinking classes, then each class contributes equally to POC export.
	\item If the Junge slope is greater than 3, as most commonly observed, ocean dynamics become the determining factor on which classes dominate: in a mostly geostrophic flow with weak vertical velocities, an intermediate sinking-velocity class will dominate POC export. In a flow with ageostrophic circulation leading to larger vertical velocities, slower sinking classes can potentially dominate export.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Remineralization processes reduce the contribution of slower-sinking particles when export dynamics are dominated by gravitational sinking (i.e., in a geostrophic flow). As flow dynamics become ageostrophic, advective downward transport leads the export and remineralization processes have a limited impact.
\end{enumerate}

%These conclusions demonstrate the importance of resolving a large portion of the particle size spectrum to properly quantify export, especially in dynamical regimes where strong ageostrophic circulation is present.

The main consequence of this result is that, when the biomass spectrum has a negative slope (i.e., $\xi>3$) , 



It is impossible to obtain $N_{slow} > N_{fast}$


In the absence of remineralization,
 
In a gravitationally-driven system (i.e., weak submesoscale activity), contribution to export generally increases as sinking-velocity increases. This is true up to the point where the totality of the particles are exported: for an equal number of particle exported, the 

Generally, export is dominated by the contribution of faster-sinking particles. For a slower-sinking velocity class to contribute more to the export than a faster-sinking velocity class, the number of particles exported must satisfy:



In the absence of remineralization, where all particles are eventually exported, this condition is only satisfied if $\xi>3$, that is if the biomass spectrum has a negative slope (see Figure \ref{fig: sinking_velocity_spectrum}). \fixme{While export will then always be dominated by faster-sinking particles, the contribution of slower-sinking particles varies greatly with the 
as a function of (1) the biomass spectral slope must be negative (i.e., $\xi>3$), and (2) the number of particles exported must be large enough. The number of particles to be exported for a slower-sinking velocity class to dominate export over a faster-sinking velocity class depend on the Junge slope and is determined by:
Under those conditions, the contribution to export as a function of sinking speed is notc linear: increasingly faster-sinking classes contribute increasingly to export, as they physically export more particles, until the sinking speed above which 100\% of the particles are exported is reached. Above this threshold, the contribution to biomass export by increasingly faster-sinking particles decreasingly contribute to export, due to the negative slope in the biomass spectra. Despite the export being dominated by faster-sinking particles, this study demonstrates that in the presence of submesoscale activity, slower-sinking particles have the potential to significantly contribute to the total export. The slowest sinking-velocity class simulated in this study contributed to up to 13\% of the total biomass export in the presence of submesoscale dynamics, for $\xi = 4$.}

The important threshold in the Junge slope highlighted in this study can be generally defined by the log-log slope between particle size and biomass content. In this study, we assume that biomass varies as the volume of the particle (B $\propto r^3$), thus obtaining a threshold of $\xi=3$. Using other relationships between biomass and particle size will not impact the main conclusions of this study, but will only affect the threshold at which slower-sinking particles contribute significantly to the export.

\subsection{Impacts of  Particle Remineralization}
\label{sec: discuss_remin}

Remineralization processes introduce a time-dependency in the relationship between biomass and sinking-velocity. A simple, yet commonly-used, remineralization scheme was imposed to the particles. As one would expect, the main impacts of implementing a remineralization scheme is a decrease in the exported biomass across all sinking-velocity classes, as well as a prolonged export timescale. This is due to the fact that, as a particle remineralizes, its sinking-velocity decreases. Because the particle now takes more time to be exported, it further remineralizes, which in turn decreases the particle's sinking-velocity. In the summer, this self-reinforcing mechanism affects slower-sinking classes the most, and therefore significantly decreases their contribution to export. In the winter, remineralization also generally reduces the amount of biomass exported, although the impact is far less pronounced and affects all sinking-velocity classes similarly. This is explained by the different mechanism dominating export in the summer and winter: In the summertime, export is dominated by gravitational sinking, which is directly impacted by remineralization processes. In the wintertime, however, export is largely driven by advective sinking through the stronger downward currents observed in the submesoscale flow. Advective sinking being independent from remineralization processes, the biomass export is less affected than in the summertime. In fact, our analysis clearly shows that remineralization processes does not significantly impact the biomass export associated with slower-sinking velocity classes over the first 5 days of the simulations. 

Finally, a very interesting feature arose from implementing a remineralization scheme to the Lagrangian particles. In the winter and with $\xi =4$, the biomass exported by the slowest-sinking class (0.025 m/day) consistently exceeds the amount of biomass exported by slightly faster-sinking classes (0.5 and 1 m/day), despite a considerably smaller number of particles exported ($<4$\% vs. 23\% and 73\%, respectively) This non-intuitive result emerges from the exponential characteristic of the remineralization scheme: the impact of remineralization thus increases with the sinking velocity. This result demonstrates that remineralization can, under specific circumstances, increase the role played by slower sinking-velocity classes. The necessary conditions involve a large Junge slope and strong submesoscale activity.
