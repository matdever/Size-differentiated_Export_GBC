	Abstract = {Abstract Argo floats have significantly improved the observation of the global ocean interior, but as the size of the database increases, so does the need for efficient tools to perform reliable quality control. It is shown here how the classical method of optimal analysis can be used to validate very large datasets before operational or scientific use. The analysis system employed is the one implemented at the Coriolis data center to produce the weekly fields of temperature and salinity, and the key data are the analysis residuals. The impacts of the various sensor errors are evaluated and twin experiments are performed to measure the system capacity in identifying these errors. It appears that for a typical data distribution, the analysis residuals extract 2/3 of the sensor error after a single analysis. The method has been applied on the full Argo Atlantic real-time dataset for the 2000?04 period (482 floats) and 15{\%} of the floats were detected as having salinity drifts or offset. A second test was performed on the delayed mode dataset (120 floats) to check the overall consistency, and except for a few isolated anomalous profiles, the corrected datasets were found to be globally good. The last experiment performed on the Coriolis real-time products takes into account the recently discovered problem in the pressure labeling. For this experiment, a sample of 36 floats, mixing well-behaved and anomalous instruments of the 2003?06 period, was considered and the simple test designed to detect the most common systematic anomalies successfully identified the deficient floats.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The incompressibility and hydrostatic approximations that are traditionally used in large-scale oceanography to make the hydrodynamic equations more amenable to numerical integration result in the primitive equations. These are ill-posed in domains with open boundaries and hence not well-suited to mesoscale or regional modeling. Instead of using the hydrostatic approximation, the authors permit a greater deviation from hydrostatic balance than what exists in the ocean to obtain a system of equations that is well-posed with the specification of pointwise boundary conditions at open or solid boundaries. These equations, formulated with a free-surface boundary, model the mesoscale flow field accurately in all three-dimensions, even the vertical. It is essential to retain the vertical component of the Coriolis acceleration in the model since it is nonhydrostatic.},

@article{Henson_2008,
	abstract = {In the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), mesoscale eddies play an important role in promoting off-shelf transport of heat, nutrients and biological populations into the HNLC water of the northeast Pacific Ocean. However, the spatial and temporal distribution of these eddies and their characteristics have not been substantially described. Here we apply an objective method (Okubo-Weiss parameter) for identifying and tracking eddies to 15 years (October 1992-2006) of satellite sea level anomaly data. The parameter allows the spatial and temporal variability in eddy activity to be defined, providing the first systematic census of anticyclonic eddies in the region. Eddies are generated principally on the eastern side of the basin and propagate either westward (Haida eddies) or along the western GOA shelf break (Alaskan Stream eddies). Seasonal maps of eddy density show fewest eddies in winter, maximum in spring/summer. The Haida and Alaskan Stream eddy corridors are clearly defined, as is an 'eddy desert' in the southwest of the basin, where the probability of an eddy being identified is zero. Maps of eddy trajectories for each year show substantial interannual variability in number and propagation paths. Greatest eddy activity occurs in 1994, 1997/1998 and 2004. Fewest eddies occur in 1996 and in the period from 1999 through 2002. Interannual variability in eddy characteristics (magnitude, propagation speed, diameter and duration) is assessed for the basin as a whole, and separately for the Alaskan Stream, Haida and Sitka/Yakutat formation regions. In general, Alaskan Stream eddies are more numerous, larger and more intense than Haida eddies. Periods of increased eddy activity do not necessarily correspond to El Ni??o events, but are associated with anomalous downwelling wind conditions along the continental margin. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {A detailed description of the Lagrangian trajectory model TRACMASS is presented. The theory behind the original scheme for steady state velocities is derived for rectangular and curvilinear grids with different vertical coordinates for the oceanic and atmospheric circulation models. Two different ways to integrate the trajectories in time in TRACMASS are presented. These different time schemes are compared by simulating inertial oscillations, which show that both schemes are sufficiently accurate not to deviate from the analytical solution. The TRACMASS are exact solutions to differential equations and can hence be integrated both forward and backward with unique solutions. Two low-order trajec- tory subgrid parameterizations, which are available in TRACMASS, are explained. They both enable an increase of the Lagrangian dispersion, but are, however, too simple to simulate some of the Lagrangian properties that are desirable. The mass conservation properties of TRACMASS are shown to make it possible to follow the water or air masses both forward and backward in time, which also opens up for all sorts of calculations of water/air mass exchanges as well as Lagrangian stream functions.},

@article{White_2015,
	abstract = {The particle size distribution (PSD) is a critical aspect of the oceanic ecosystem. Local variability in the PSD can be indicative of shifts in microbial community structure and reveal patterns in cell growth and loss. The PSD also plays a central role in particle export by influencing settling speed. Satellite-based models of primary productivity (PP) often rely on aspects of photophysiology that are directly related to community size structure. In an effort to better understand how variability in particle size relates to PP in an oligotrophic ecosystem, we collected laser diffraction-based depth profiles of the PSD and pigment-based classifications of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) on an approximately monthly basis at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series Station ALOHA, in the North Pacific subtropical gyre. We found a relatively stable PSD in the upper water column. However, clear seasonality is apparent in the vertical distribution of distinct particle size classes. Neither laser diffraction-based estimations of relative particle size nor pigment-based PFTs was found to be significantly related to the rate of 14C-based PP in the light-saturated upper euphotic zone. This finding indicates that satellite retrievals of particle size, based on particle scattering or ocean color would not improve parameterizations of present-day bio-optical PP models for this region. However, at depths of 100–125 m where irradiance exerts strong control on PP, we do observe a significant linear relationship between PP and the estimated carbon content of 2–20 lm particles.},

Making this approximation, an analytic approach is made to a frontogenesis model based on the classic horizontal deformation field. Kelvin's circulation theorem suggests the introduction of a new independent variable in the cross-front direction. The problem is solved exactly for a Boussinesq, uniform potential vorticity fluid. Non-Boussinesq, non-uniform potential vorticity, latent heat, and surface friction effects are all studied. Using a two-region fluid we model the effects of confluence near the tropopause. A similar approach is made to the appearance of fronts in the finite-amplitude development of the simplest Eady wave; this is also solved analytically. Based on the surface fronts produced by these models, we give a general model of a strong surface front. There is a tendency to form discontinuities in a finite time.},
